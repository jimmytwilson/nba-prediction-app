## My app

Hello Basketball loving people!

This app is for those who are interested in my week of learning Python and Machine Learning.

I made this as a Student at Code Chrysalis during polyglotal week (week where we learn a new language from scratch)

### Future improvements

* As this was my first time with Python, the Machine Learning predictability is not at a high accuracy percentage. I would like to increase this accuracy.
* Add more features and inputs so you can see all the data and it is very customizable
* Deploy this app. Potentially using a service such as Heroku
